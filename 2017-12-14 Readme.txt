Open Source Overview
============================
V2I Hub
Version 3.0
V2I Hub was developed to support jurisdictions in deploying connected vehicle technology by reducing 
integration issues and enabling use of their existing transportation management hardware and systems. 
V2I Hub is a software platform that utilizes plugins to translate messages between different devices 
and run transportation management and connected vehicle applications on roadside equipment.


Security and Passwords
----------------------
V2I Hub is middleware that runs on Linux Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. It is recommended that appropriate security 
and firewall settings be used on the computer running Linux, including conforming to your agency's 
security best practices and IT protocols.

For configuration and maintenance, the V2I Hub software includes an Administration Portal that runs 
in a web browser on the host device. The default Username for accessing this Administration Portal is 
v2iadmin and the default password is V2iHub#123. It is strongly recommended that the ivpadmin 
password be changed with the first login to the Administration Portal via the menu on the left. 
Passwords must be a minimum of 8 characters, with at least 1 number, 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase, 
and 1 special character.  Additional users can be created using the Administration Portal by selecting 
Manage Users from the left menu.  While managing users, you can add new users and delete the 
default user ivpadmin.  If you want to delete the ivpadmin default user, It is recommended that you 
create a new user with admin privileges, login as that user, then delete the ivpadmin default user.

System Requirements
-------------------
The V2I Hub software can run on most Linux based computers with 
Pentium core processers, with at least two gigabytes of RAM and at least 64GB of drive space.
Performance of the software will be based on the computing power and available RAM in 
the system.  The project was developed and tested on a machine 
with a core i3 processor, 4GB of memory, 64GB of hard drive space, running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

Compilation Instructions
------------------------


To Compile the V2I Hub software
Run the following from the src directory

$ cd tmx
$ cmake .
$ make 
$ sudo make install
$ cd ../v2i-hub
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/var/www/plugins .
$ make
$ sudo make install


This will create a lib and bin folder in both the tmx and v2i-hub directories under src, and install the libraies on your build system.  The lib folder will contain libtmxapi.so and libtmxutils.a.  The bin directory
will contain the main tmxcore application along with zip files for each plugin.  

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
- install lamp-server
$ sudo apt-get install lamp-server^

enter a root password (i.e. ivp)

- install database
- - modify the install_db.sh script.  Modify the value for DBROOTPASS to the password that was used for root during the
previous step
- - save and execute the script

$ cd DatabaseSetup
$ sudo ./install_db.sh

- run the web portal installs script from the TMX directory

$ cd WebPortalSetup
$ sudo ./web_portal_setup.sh

- run tmxcore locally from /usr/local/bin as sudo (i.e. $ sudo /usr/local/bin/tmxcore )

the portal uses a self signed ssl certificate.  You must accept the certificate in your web browser before accessing the web site.  You do this once for your browser.

- open firefox and navigate to https://localhost:19760
- click advanaced, the click add exception
- a popup will open, and click confirm security exception

portal can be accessed at: http://localhost/admin/admin.html.  In the text box on the left, change the ip address to 127.0.0.1.  Make sure SSL is enabled (SSL button should be blue).


Set Up and Configuration Instructions
-------------------------------------

NOTE: The MAP plugin comes with the map for Turner Faribank already configured. 

More documentation will be available soon for configuration for the plugins.
