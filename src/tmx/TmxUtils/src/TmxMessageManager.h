/**
 * This class provides an optimized solution for injecting a TMX message
 * into the core, or processing incoming messages from the core.
 *
 * This class is not required, since processing the message can be handled by each plugin.
 * However, the intent of this class is to provide a ubiquitous solution on how to handle
 * and process incoming messages for a plugin, and force the processing into a separate thread
 * so overall throughput is optimized.  In other words, the messages can be handled roughly
 * in the order they are received, irrespective of the rate of entry.  Additionally, this class
 * helps any plugin that receives messages externally, say from a radio, be most efficient in
 * publishing that message without effecting the incoming rate.
 *
 * Note that this class heavily relies on threading, and the messages are tagged
 * to a specific thread by a 2-byte identifier.
